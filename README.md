## UX
The aim was to produce a sleak efficient E-commerce store that boosted game sales while,
engaging with the user and bringing them enjoyment and excitement for their purchase in the process.

### Strategy 

Given the type of business to consumer interaction the site uses there were three main points to strategy when designing:
- A streamlined checkout process with a minimum of steps in order to have a minimum of time between the emotional decision to purchase and 
the completion of that purchase for the user. 
- A stress on engagement through media to encourage a user's emotional connection to a product. 
- Simple interactivity and feedback to the user to create a simple and relaxing shopping experience.

### Scope
Functional features required:
- Game App
- Twitch App
- Bag App
- Checkout App
- Profiles App

Content required
- A way for user to experience/connect with a game without buying it (through media).
- Media aimed at enthusing the emotional decision behind a purchase. 
- Navigational streamlinging through a sidenav to allow easy use and efficiently transport users to the game they are interested in.

### Structure
For information architecture see [**Database Schema**](https://github.com/jamiebird119/game_space/blob/792ef9b4cec575be88bfac5a9415c218069f3f8a/database-schema.png)

### Skeleton 
For wireframes see [wireframes-folder](https://github.com/jamiebird119/game_space/blob/bcce69db511ec767cd7842d67e1c7cf19f2eb588/wireframes) on github.

### Surface
#### Design
##### Theme
Bootswatch darkly was used for a general dulcet theme and styling with majority of elements following this format for a consistent 
and crisp user experience. Rounded images and use of cards for game details collate relavent information for the user.

##### Icons
Font Awesome is used to provide iconography that is consistent and informs the user to increase the usability of the site. Branded logos 
such as that of Playstation and Xbox were used from Font Awesome because of their notability and eyecatching familiarity assisting in giving the site purpose clearly
and adding value to the products provided.

### Features Left to implement

**Game Reviews Section**
- The user profile image upload is a precurser to this in that the idea would be to have the users image and review posted at the bottom of the game details page allowing it to be viewed by other users.
- This was not implemented as it was decided it was not necessary for the core functionality of the site, however could be added to increase user engagement.

**User Wishlist**
- The ability for users to add games to a wishlist on their account.
- This would allow developers to get feedback on game popularities and allow the user to recieve updates when their favourite games go on sale or have specific events.

**Twitch and Social Account Logins** 
- Allow users to register using twitch/discord account info.
- This would streamline the registration/login processes for the user and allow them to collate their information into one place.

**Additional game media**
- At present, apart from streams, game media is restricted to one image at a time. Ideally this would be updated to a gallery to give a more rounder,
view of the game without users having to watch a stream. For the purposes of load times and keeping file storage to a minimum this has not been implemented yet however.

**Links to related products**
- This feature would link similar games (for example sequels or prequels) or games that have similar genre tags. This would be viewed on the games page and 
would allow a browsing user to see other games they may like increasing the likelihood of them making a purchase. 

**SuperUser Account Models**
- Creating a model specifically to handle super users so each can only edit/update games they have added.

## Testing
See [testing link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BrhNhX1Fiv-3raMT9crMyYyqyEfbfkIgaHa_c50PAEY/edit#gid=787376127) second tab with all details of testing.
## Deployment

### Home App
Once django was imported and installed, the first thing created was the home app. As part of this a simple view and url were created and a full base template upon which
all future htmls would be built. This contained blocks for all major features and navigation and menu features present on each page. 

### Game App
The Game App followed this, with the creation of the Genre, Console and Game models. The genre and console models were linked by a many to many relationship 
with the game model. With model data then loaded using fixtures this relationship had to be added manually later in the site admin page. For feasibility it was the most
efficient method for the small sample data however for more extensive site data this ideally would be automated. 
Using the newly made models, the game and game details pages were created to render data to the user. With this search query functionality was created to handle 
keywords searches able to be matched to the name, description, console or genre of the game. In built filter select was added and a product count and search query 
given to users to show in results what they were searching.  

### Twitch API App
From the game details page a smaller navigation was included to make space for the twitch area. Using the twitch developer page
it became obvious that users first needed authorisation using an OAuth token. This was returned after setting up the required variables in twitch
and used to return a set of stream data for a particular game_id. Initially prior to the development of the streams return, a snippet was prototyped in repl.it using a fixed token and the name of a game to return a game_id, which became 
the basis for the return function used in product management when adding a new game. 
The stream data could then be rendered to the stream.html with a stream_id variable used to create a link to each stream that would then be loaded in the embed player on twitch_stream.html. 
(**NB** While each new user gets an OAuth token that is subsequently saved in the session cookies, it is not clear whether this value expires. Ideally code would be altered to included
this possible eventuality but for now it serves the purpose)

### Bag App
The bag app was created and along with bag.html a context processor was created for the bag contents. The functionality to add items to the bag
was also then added and to give each item a console and quantity. It was decided that items can only be added one at a time by the user instead of choosing a quantity, becuase how often would a user
want several hard copies of a game on the same console. The value can be editted in the bag app however. Bag tools were also created to work out totals.

### Checkout App
This lead nicely on to the checkout app which was created. As part of this the first items initialised were the Order, Orderlineitem and Discount models all of which 
would be necassary for full checkout. The OrderLineItem was an inline portion of the order model and was created for each item in a user bag. The Discount model was an optional 
foreign key field on the order model. Discount were applied using a charfield primary key code, and a json field containing information on to what games the 
discount applied. Due to the foreign key nature of the field it does mean that only one discount can be applied the a bag, however this is made aware to the user upon successful application 
of a discount. Forms were then produced from the OrderModel and integrated with stripe to the checkout page. The stripe payment intent was set up along with 
webhook and handler to process incomplete orders. 

### Profiles App
Lastly prior to deployment the profiles app was created with the UserProfile model being initialised first. This contains default information for the user
which linked to checkout and could be saved by the user when checking out. The user profile page was created to take in form data if the user wanted to change this. 
A profile image field was also added and could be updated using this profile page. This as it has been said earlier would be a precursor to a review section where the user image and review 
would be shown on the game details page when they leave a review. 

### Development to Deployment
The site was originally developed on Gitpod and can be run locally using:
`$ python3 manage.py runserver` 
This was then pushed to a heroku provider available at 
[GameSpace](https://game-space-ecommerce.herokuapp.com/)

The differences between the developmental and deployment version are as follows:
- The developmental server hosts media and static files locally whereas the deployed version uses an Amazon S3 bucket for file hosting. 
- In development emails sent to users are sent to the development console whereas in the deployed version the backend uses smtp to sent the emails to the user. 
- On the developmental server an sql database is used where as on the deployed version a postgres database provides access to models. 
(**NB** *It is IMPORTANT to note that on the developmental server not all genre/console to game relationships have been fully implemented, as they have on the deployed site. The developemental version will not allow the username to add games without console values to the bag so if using dev version to test please use a game with a console value only!*)
- Finally debug is set to false on the deployed version and USE_AWS is set to True.
